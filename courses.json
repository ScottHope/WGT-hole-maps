    "BethpageBlack":["The opening hole requires a choice right off the bat - lay back with something less than a driver or challenge the rather severe dogleg right. The front third of this putting green is severely sloped back to front, which will likely bring balls played short and with spin back to the very front of the green.","At 389 yards, the second hole is the only par 4 measuring less than 400 yards. The ability to curve the ball off the tee around the large oaks will be of great benefit in widening the fairway. The green is perched up on a ridge, so only the top half of the flagstick is visible for the short-iron approach shot.","A new teeing green has been added since the 2002 U.S. Open, making this hole the longest par 3. At 241 yards, the third plays to a diagonally-set green effectively making it fairly shallow in depth. Recovery shots require a great touch since the putting green falls off in all directions. The putting green itself is relatively flat.","Perhaps Bethpage's best hole in terms of beauty and strategy, the fourth is a par 5 measuring 517 yards. This is a birdie hole that will give players options. It can be played conservatively as a three-shotter or may be challenged in two. The green, which slopes front to back away from the player, is not particularly receptive to approaches from the lower drive zone.","At 478 yards, the par-4 fifth will be one of the toughest holes. The downhill tee shot is played to a fairway that sits at a slight left-to-right diagonal. Tee shots must hug the right-side cross bunker in order to not be blocked by large, overhanging oaks left of the hole. The green is relatively small and slopes back to front. Par is a good score here.","Most players will lay-up their tee shots to the top of the hill overlooking the green. This will leave mid-irons to the green that sits some 50 feet below the drive zone. However, the USGA converted the hillside from rough to fairway since 2002, allowing for the option to drive to the bottom of the hill. This par 4 should yield a fair amount of pars and birdies.","With a new teeing ground that added 36 yards since 2002, the 525-yard seventh will play as the longest par 4 in U.S. Open history. Long irons and hybrids will be used for approach shots to a green that is closely guarded by a deep bunker on the front right. Par will be an excellent score on what will likely be the toughest hole on the front nine.","This downhill one-shotter will likely end up being the most exciting of the par 3s. The hole location in the front requires players to carefully consider just how aggressive they want to be with their tee shots. However, conservative play off the tee will call for a deft putting touch coming back down the hill to the front portion of green.","No tee shot has changed more since 2002 than the one at the ninth hole. Since Rees Jones' installation of a new teeing ground some 40 yards back and a new left bunker, most approach shots will now be played from a severely sloping right-to-left lie to a green that is mostly blind. The putting green is fairly large and flat.","At 508 yards, the 10th is one of three par-4 holes measuring more than 500 yards - a first for any U.S. Open. A slight dogleg to the left, the hole's location on the course exposes it to the wind - and also exposes errant tee shots to the fine fescue grasses in the rough. Deep bunkers guard both sides of the drive zone. A par on this hole will be a very good score.","Like the 10th, this straight-away, 435-yard hole is out in the open and exposed to the winds. The tee shot is played to a somewhat blind fairway with deep bunkers guarding both sides. The mid- to short-iron approach shots must be played beneath the hole. The putting green is one of the Black Course's most difficult, sloping steeply from back to front.","The last of a difficult three-hole stretch, this 504-yard par 4 played as the second hardest during the 2002 U.S. Open. Landing the fairway from the tee is crucial as there is commonly a left-to-right prevailing wind against. The putting green is one of the largest on the course, but has a pronounced tier separating the front and back of the green.","At 605 yards, the 13th is the longest hole on the course but still reachable in two shots by longer-hitting players. The bunker that appears to front the green is actually about 30 paces short, allowing for run-up approaches. The green slopes generally back to front. Birdies and even eagles are a possibility, but overly aggressive play may translate into bogey.","At 159 yards, the 14th is the shortest and should be the easiest of the four par 3s. A miss short will likely take birdie out of play while a miss long over the green will almost certainly take par out of the equation. The 14th is still a birdie hole, but a mediocre tee shot may make par challenging.","At 458 yards, the slight dogleg 15th is not the Black Course's longest par 4, but it will likely again be the toughest hole for the U.S. Open. Finding the fairway off the tee will be crucial to having a realistic chance to reach the green in regulation. The 15th putting green is without a doubt the scariest on the course as it slopes severely from the back left to the front right.","This gentle dogleg left 490-yarder is played from high up on a teeing ground that overlooks the entire hole. The green is guarded by deep bunkers that partially obscure the view on approach shots. The putting surface has \"bowl-like\" features on the right and left, making both recovery shots and putts a challenge.","The 207-yard 17th plays uphill to an hourglass-shaped putting surface that is mostly blind from the teeing ground and is surrounded by deep bunkers. The putting green is very wide but relatively shallow in depth and is bisected by a ridge that separates two distinct tiers. The 17th is sure to be an exciting hole that might greatly impact the outcome on the final day.","The home hole provides a dramatic finish. The downhill tee shot on this 411-yard par 4 gives the player a choice - lay up short of the deep cluster of bunkers or be more aggressive off the tee and attempt to drive his ball between or beyond the bunkers. The uphill approach shot is played to a blind putting surface that cants from back to front."],
    "TorreyPines":["Favor left side of fairway on tee shot to leave an open look at the green. A good tee shot will leave a mid to long iron approach to green protected by two green side bunkers. Don't go long on your approach, as it will leave you a difficult pitch to get up and down. A par on this hole is a great way to start your round.","3 wood or hybrid is recommended on this short but demanding par 4. Favor the left side of the fairway. Avoid going right as it will leave you a blind second shot amongst a small grove of Torreys. Good tee shot leaves you a short iron into a green protected by two massive bunkers.","Overlooking La Jolla, South Course's signature Par 3, is the most picturesque of all the Par 3's on the course. Club selection is of utmost importance as the hole can play as short as a 9 iron, and as long as a hybrid. Playing downhill, a good tee shot will leave you middle of green. Avoid going long here as it will leave you a very difficult pitch to get up and down.","The second longest of the daunting Par 4's at Torrey Pines, hole #4 requires a good tee shot that will leave you a long iron or fairway metal into a green protected by a bunker on the left. Play approach to the right of the green to allow the contours of the green complex to feed the ball to the middle of the green. A par here is a good score.","A good tee shot will leave you beyond the rise and past both fairway bunkers leaving you mid iron into a green protected by two greenside bunkers.","Playing downwind this dogleg right Par 5 requires a tee shot that favors the right side to avoid the fairway bunkers on the left. A good layup shot will leave you a wedge into a two-tiered green.","This dogleg right Par 4 requires a tee shot that favors the left side. A good tee shot will leave you a mid iron approach to an elevated green that slopes severely back to front. Don't go long here and avoid the massive greenside bunker on the right. As with all the Par 4's, par is a good score here.","Add an extra club on this uphill Par 3 to avoid the bunker protecting the front of this green.","Grip it and rip it! What you see is what you get with this straight Par 5. The par 5 is reachable by only the longest hitters, so most players must hit the fairway from the tee to allow an aggressive lay up, which in turn will allow an accurate third shot and a chance to make birdie.","The best way to start the second nine with a birdie is to hit left center of the fairway from the tee, then hit a short iron to a sloping green that is guarded by bunkers on the front left and right.","Club selection is key on this long downhill Par 3. This par 3 usually plays several yards longer than its official yardage because it plays into and across the prevailing wind. Don't look for many approach shots to come to rest in the center of the green, as a severe slope will filter shots from right to left.","A generous fairway invites players to be aggressive off the tee. Anything less than a well-struck drive won't allow this green to be reached in two. The ideal position for those who miss the green is short, since the green, which runs some 35 yards deep, is receptive to uphill chip shots.","A new tee has been added, back and to the left, calling for a drive of at least 240 yards to carry the canyon. Should players choose to go for the green in two, they will need to carry the second shot some 260 yards as the green is elevated and protected by bunkers and rough in front.","With the canyon running all along the left of the fairway, players will be sure to play the ball safely out to the right, probably with a fairway wood. The most difficult hole location will be back right, but any shots missed long could result in bogey or worse, as there are hazards just off the back of the green.","Players who shape their shots will not find much room here. Eucalyptus trees protect both sides of this tight fairway and the slightly uphill green slopes aggressively from right to left. Shots coming from the right had better land softly if a player wants to have putter in hand for his third shot.","Two teeing grounds will have a dramatic effect on how this hole is played. The shorter tee, to the left, brings two greenside bunkers into play, but players can aim right and ride the prevailing breeze. The front of the green is open from the longer tee, but the wind can complicate the angle.","A high draw from the tee will take the fairway bunker on the right, 275 yards to the front of it, out of play. That will leave a middle-to-short-iron approach to an elevated, wide, and severely undulating green protected by two bunkers in front."," The closing hole is a great par 5 - basically straight but with a twist in the drive zone - on which anything can happen. Just ask Bruce Devlin. In contention for the 1975 Andy Williams San Diego Open, the Australian took six hacks to get his ball out of the water in front of the green on his way to making a 10. The pond is now called \"Devlin's Billabong\"."],
    "WolfCreek":["Teeing off from an elevated tee there is a fairly generous fairway with room to the right. There's a hidden water hazard over the fairway bunkers on the right for your second shot. If going for the green don’t miss it on the side the flag is on. Once on the green there are 3 tiers sloping back to front. Good chance to make par or better.","Another tee box well above the fairway. The high percentage shot is out to the right side of the fairway. Remember it will play shorter because of the elevation. This will leave you an approach to an uphill two tier green that slopes from back to front.","Uphill par 3 that will play longer than the tee marker says. A high soft shot is required to hit the green. Anything on the green is a great shot.","One of the few flat holes at Wolf Creek and a big risk reward opportunity. With an accurate drive hitting the green is possible, but with the slightest mishit or push a big number is brought into play. The smart play is straight down the fairway which will leave a short approach to a small well-guarded green.","Hole 5 is a reachable par 5 with an elevated tee box. The fairway slants away from tee box and the further left you go the more carry is required. The aggressive play over the rocks will leave a short shot into the green and a birdie is a real possibility. A large slope bisects the green and over the green presents a straight downhill chip.","Tee off from an elevated tee with Wolf Creek cutting across the fairway at 270 yards. You have a choice to either hit it over the creek or lay up short. The green is 34 yards long with a large slope in the back right of green.","Another hole that can be driven. If successful you'll have a great opportunity for birdie, but if not double bogey or worse is a real possibility. A long carry is required and anything short of the green will roll off the false front into the water. Distance control is very important.","The most picturesque par 3 on the course and the most challenging. The hole plays downhill with water on three sides so accuracy is crucial. The only bail out is to the right of the green.","A little uphill par 4 with reachable deep fairway bunkers. A good drive should carry all the bunkers leaving a short wedge shot to a three tier green. Make sure to hit the tier where the hole is located.","The longest par 4 on the course. The tee shot plays a touch uphill and you will want to favor the right side where there is more room. The green is long and well-guarded by bunkers. A par on this hole is a great score.","Another picturesque par 3 from an elevated tee. The green slopes from back to front. If indecisive about club selection take one less. It is easier to get up and down from the front.","A reachable downhill par 5. Anything left of the fairway will end up in the water so favor the right side off the tee. Going for the green in 2 requires one of the most precise long shots on the course. The hole has a three tier green.","Long hitters can carry the large hill to the right of the fairway and hit the green. The safe shot is a well-placed tee shot in the fairway which leaves an uphill wedge shot to the green. The front of the green has a very severe slope.","One of the most often photographed holes on the course. A long drive just to the right of the fairway bunkers will leave a short uphill shot to a narrow well bunkered green.","Don’t sleep on this short straight forward par 3. The right side of the green is severely sloped to the left and any shot left in those deep bunkers is very difficult to get up and down.","This is a difficult fairway to hit. Anything to the right or left of the fairway will end up at the bottom of the canyon. An accurate straight drive will yield a straight forward short iron shot into the green.","A very picturesque par 5. One of the most elevated tee shots on the course with danger on both sides. Be careful of the well-positioned creek crossing the fairway. A good drive short of the creek will leave a long approach to a green with trouble on 3 sides.","This hole can be driven with a great tee shot. However the conservative shot is a 210 yard shot just to the left of the right fairway bunker which will leave 120 yard shot to a three tier green. Distance control on the second shot is of the utmost importance."],
    "ErinHills":["The opening tee shot skirts the wetlands, and the fairway is canted from left to right toward it. Favor the right side of the fairway, but be wary of the cluster of bunkers 50 yards short of the green. This green favors a run-up shot more than any other on the course.","This classic strategic hole allows the player who successfully challenges the left side of the fairway an unobstructed view of the smallest green on the course. Those who lay up short of the fairway bunkers from the tee will be left with a blind approach shot.","Bunkers challenge the tee shot on the first long par 4, and the fairway slopes from right to left in the landing area. On the uphill approach shot, there is more room than appears between the front bunker and the green, which features a pronounced ridge.","This demanding tee shot must negotiate challenging rough on the left and an encroaching bunker on the right. More bunkers could influence the second shot, which is played over a central bunker to a shallow putting surface with wetlands just behind it.","The surroundings here perhaps best capture the distinctive character of Erin Hills. The slight dogleg-left hole favors a right-to-left tee shot, as the approach from the right side is likely to be blind. It is possible to use the slope on the left to bounce the ball onto the putting surface.","The prevailing westerly wind is at the player’s back, and only the front one-third of the green is visible from the tee, with much of the rest of the putting surface sloping to the rear. Getting close to a hole location on the front part of the green is particularly challenging.","This rolling three-shot hole plays past the bell that had been used to signal the “all clear” on the now defunct par-3 Dell Hole. Several bunkers dot the area where players would likely hit a lay-up shot, and the elevated green is two-tiered, with a plateau on the left side.","Similar to several holes at The Olympic Club, the landing area on this right-to-left dogleg slopes from left to right. Players who can shape their tee shots with a draw will have an advantage. The approach shot is to a shallow green that slopes from back to front and is flanked by three bunkers.","Club selection can be challenging on the shortest hole on the course, which plays from an elevated tee. The green angles and slopes from left to right, making it somewhat of a mirror-image Redan design. Saving par will be particularly challenging for those who miss long or left.","Despite the blind tee shot, the expansive fairway encourages the player to swing freely. A downslope in the fairway can help the drive get closer to the shallow green, which is heavily protected on the right. The closely mown area to the right and behind the green can be used as a backstop to work the ball closer to the hole.","After a number of demanding holes, No. 11 provides the player with a bit of a breather, with a generous fairway and an approach that is typically just a short iron. However, care must be taken with the small green that slopes from left to right. The back nine of Erin Hills presents several challenging par 4 holes of varying length.","With its dramatic topography and partially hidden green, this hole showcases the minimalist approach that the architects took in creating Erin Hills. The tee shot must reach a plateau to afford the player a shorter approach shot to a green set in a hollow. Players who take an aggressive line on this dogleg-right tee shot could be rewarded with a shorter approach shot.","This hole is a rendition of the classic hill-to-hill par 3. The player’s eyes are naturally drawn toward the expansive bunker to the left of the green, to which a swale on the left side of the green directs errant shots. But the green also falls away to the front, right and back, making a miss in those directions difficult to recover from.","This par 5 provides a gambling opportunity for the bold player. The player who lays up with their second shot faces a nearly blind approach to a green that is set at an awkward angle. The player who fails in the attempt to reach the green with their second shot will have no bargain, with thick rough short of the green and a false front combined with a steep drop-off to the right that runs toward a small stream.","This strategic short par 4 presents the player with several options: lay up short of the three fairway bunkers, place the tee shot between the bunkers, or try to reach the elevated green from the tee. The dramatic drop-off to the right of the green will influence players to keep their approach to the left, but a ridge that runs through the green will leave a difficult two-putt for the player who has to negotiate it.","This narrow, slightly angled green is nestled against the hillside to its left. A player might assume that the hillside will help to kick the ball onto the putting surface, but there are hidden bunkers at the base of the hill that can ensnare a ball that is bouncing off the hillside.","A tee shot down the right side of the fairway will provide the player with a clear view of the green, which is tucked behind a hill on the left. Those who play down the left side of the fairway will face a partially blind approach. This hole has no bunkers, relying on the natural terrain to defend the putting surface and repel inaccurate approach shots.","The closing hole at Erin Hills features Holy Hill in the distance. The natural tendency is to play toward the green on this long par 5, but the player is well advised to play to the right on their second shot. A cluster of bunkers visually dominates the approach shot, but players need to be careful not to miss the green to the left, where the slope will take the ball well away from the putting surface."],
    "ChambersBay":["The par-4 opening hole at Chambers Bay provides a very manageable start to the round. Most tee shots will finish short of the crest of the hill in the fairway, leaving a partially blind second shot. Approach shots must favor the right side and can utilize the contours along that side of the fairway to find the putting surface.","The tee shot on this medium-length par 4 plays through the dunes to a narrowed fairway. The shortest approach is from the left side of the fairway, but that route brings a large bunker into play. Play down the right side to take advantage of an open entrance to the green, which slopes from right to left and is bisected by a large ridge.","The first of the short holes at Chambers Bay is a mid-iron for most players. The kidney-shaped green is guarded on the left by a deep bunker and a swale off the putting surface collects shots struck too long. A large kick-slope on the right redirects shots toward the center of the green.","The fairway on this medium-length, uphill par 5 slopes significantly from left to right. The green is reachable in two shots for long hitters, though tee shots must avoid the immense bunker on the right. The green complex is framed by a large bunker front and right with three blowout bunkers behind. The large and heavily contoured green features a right-hand hole location bordered on three sides by sand.","The elevated fifth tee offers players a panoramic view of Puget Sound and Chambers Bay. This long straightaway hole rewards a drive down the center. While the fairway is generous, massive bunker complexes protect either side. Tee shots that land left of center will chase toward the bunker and be faced with a semi blind approach. The green on this long par 4 is guarded by a deep fronting bunker.","Depending on the placement of the tee markers, the sixth hole is either a long, dogleg right or a short straightaway par 4. Regardless, favor the left side for an unobstructed view of a green perched between two bunkers. The slope from back to front encourages a low running approach.","This long uphill par 4 turns hard from left to right. Taking an aggressive line over the large bunker on the right invites a shorter approach to the green, but also brings trouble into play. Tee shots played safely to the left will face a blind approach over the hummocks fronting the green. The severely uphill approach plays much longer than the actual yardage.","This fairway is much wider than it appears from the tee, but does slope from left to right. A drive struck down the left side of the fairway will be redirected to the middle, offering an open view of a long and narrow green. Contours to the left and in the back of the green will move approach shots back toward the center of the green.","The teeing ground on this long par 3 is perched nearly 100 feet above the green. The oversized green slopes from left to right, providing assistance to players hoping to avoid the menacing bunker short and right of the putting surface. The contours on and around the green provide ample opportunity to get close to the hole. An alternate, lower tee has been installed to provide variety in setup for the U.S. Open.","This medium-length par 4 splits the two largest dunes on the golf course. The fairway narrows steadily the closer one comes to the green, making club selection off the tee crucial. A relatively flat green is nestled between the dunes and is flanked by deep bunkers front right and back left.","This long par 4 plays straightaway, while the fairway curls in and around the dunes and waste areas. A tee shot over the central fairway dune leaves a middle-to long iron approach. The green is set into a slope from right to left and features a ridge bisecting the surface lengthwise.","An uphill, drivable par 4, the 12th is the narrowest hole on course. Lay up short or challenge the blowout bunker fronting the green. A very large and undulating green set in a punchbowl requires an accurate approach or lag putt. Strong contours all around this green invite creativity and imagination into your short game.","The placement of the tee shot is critical on this strong, dogleg right par-4. Though the fairway is the widest on the course, a tee shot down the right significantly reduces the length of the approach. A central bunker requires players to carefully choose their line of attack on the approach. Shots struck off line will be rejected by the knob on the left of the green, or a slope falling away on the right.","The first task on this dramatic downhill par 4 is to decide how aggressive you wish to be off the tee. A large, deep waste area must be carried onto a fairway sloping from right to left. Mounding short and right of the putting surface will funnel shots onto a large green that tilts toward the fairway in front, but then slopes away toward a collection area beyond.","This short par 3 plays from an elevated tee and is fully exposed to the prevailing wind, making club selection critical. The well-defended green slopes from left to right. Standing watch in the distance, the Lone Fir is the only tree on the course.","This medium-length par 4 curves gently around a long bunker that flanks the entire right side of the hole. Tee shots should favor the left side to account for slope toward the bunker. The tabletop green is the smallest on the course and also slopes dramatically from left to right.","With two distinct teeing grounds, this picturesque par 3 plays into the prevailing breeze. The lower tee offers a level shot and requires a long carry over the waste bunker, while the upper tee provides a drop shot with full view of the green and its surrounds. The putting surface is split into obvious halves, allowing only accurately struck shots near the hole.","The home hole is a slightly uphill par 5, surrounded by dunes. The remnants of vast concrete sorting bins loom over the teeing grounds. After navigating a fairway dotted by bunkers and swales, built to accommodate play as a par 4 or par 5 during the U.S. Open, a large green featuring multiple levels and strong contours awaits. Imagination and a deft putting touch are required to pass the final exam in this championship test."],
    "BandonDunes":["Club selection is crucial to this shallow, firm green. A sod-faced bunker awaits short shots, and natural fescues approach quickly from behind. A shot played into the front right opening of the green will serve you well to any hole location.

Carrying the mound in front is essential to safely finding your way away from trouble and onto the green. Specific Course and Hole: Bandon Preserve #4.","Playing from an elevated tee, this green has a deep swale that will come into play for most players. The best shots will be played with a lower trajectory and land short of the swale, rolling down and through to the back third of the green. A two-putt on this hole is a feat of its own. Specific Course and Hole: Old Macdonald #8.","Don’t let the length of this hole give you a false sense of security. Club selection is critical, as your ball must end up on the same tier of the green as the hole. This green is the most undulating on the course, and a two putt will be well earned. Specific Course and Hole: Bandon Trails #5.","With the most dramatic elevation change at Bandon Preserve, this hole offers spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean. The prevailing wind will challenge a high ball flight. Avoid left as it slopes severely away from the green. Specific Course and Hole: Bandon Preserve #5.","The biggest obstacle at this hole - besides the distraction of the scenery - is the thick rough and mounding left of the green. A large elevation change from the upper tee combined with the prevailing wind, make club selection critical on this par 3. A safe place to leave your approach is short of the green. Specific Course and Hole: Pacific Dunes #10.","This short par 3 is a strong challenge. The green is surrounded by native beach grass, bunkers, and gorse. Forget about the hole location and focus on getting your ball in the center of this green, the smallest at Pacific Dunes. Specific Course and Hole: Pacific Dunes #11.","Against the prevailing wind, this hole requires much more club than the yardage suggests. Beware of the deep, sod-faced bunker on the left. A missed shot to the right of the green leaves a manageable chip to save par. Specific Course and Hole: Bandon Dunes #6.","A stout par three that plays into a plateau green running from front-right to back-left. Players who can land their ball on the front- right and chase it back will have the best chance at making par. Specific Course and Hole: Old Macdonald #12.","An approach that misses the green on this par-3 leaves one of the most difficult up-and-downs on the course. Figure your yardage to the front of the green, because balls will certainly release to the hole. Specific Course and Hole: Pacific Dunes #14.","A par three framed by a menacing bunker right and two bunkers back and left. A false front forces you to fly the ball well onto the green.

    "PebbleBeach":["Take aim at the right edge of the first bunker beyond the fairway and try not to cut the dogleg - it doesn't pay. The approach shot plays somewhat longer than the actual yardage and the green is tightly bunkered left and right.","Find the fairway long off the tee and you can reach the green in two. Another option is to lay up short of the deep bunker or barranca hidden 75 yards from the green.","A slight draw around the corner of this dogleg leaves you in perfect position for a short pitch to the green. If you play it safe to the far right of the barranca, be prepared to contend with the bunkers flanking the right side of the green.","A long iron or 3-wood to carry the long bunker in the center of the fairway is your best bet. This short hole is tightly guarded with a cluster of menacing bunkers and the green slopes decidedly back and front.","Opened for play in January 1999, this spectacular addition is sure to test your mettle. Designed by Jack Nicklaus, this beautiful par-3 sits naturally upon the bluffs overlooking Stillwater Cove. The ocean breezes will affect club selection. The safest play is to the left-center of this green.","The optimum placement for the tee shot is left center of the fairway. Your second shot must carry the steep slope but beware of the bunkers on the left.","Club selection is predicated on wind factors. Knock down a short iron and keep the ball from ballooning in the wind. Play it safe to the middle of the green.","Tee it up over the aiming rock and note wind conditions. A well-placed drive will leave you with a middle iron shot across a deep oceanic chasm. Take a deep breath and fire to the middle of the green here, but take heed: this green is sloped severely from back to front.","Take aim at the left center of the fairway, hit it long and beware of the left side. Side hill lies are the norm for long iron second shots so beware of the ocean on the right. There is a deep-bunkered gully left and short that will punish a timid approach. This is truly the most difficult hole on the course.","A strong tee shot to the left center of this sloping fairway will leave you with a medium iron shot. Take enough club on your approach to carry the inlet on the right. Bunkers left and long will capture errant shots. The green slopes from left to right.","A well-struck tee shot will take you left of center, avoiding the bunkers left and right on your approach. Take enough club on this uphill approach, but be careful not to over club. This green is fast from back to front.","The staggered bunkers in front give a false perspective on this long par-3. Club selection is key in approaching this wide but shallow green. The wind above the trees, undetectable by eyeing the 12th green, may alter your shot.","This uphill par-4 plays longer than the yardage. Line up over the right edge of the fairway bunker and hit your best tee shot. The uphill approach shot calls for an extra club. Shots to the right side of the green will slide left on this, the most severely sloped and quickest green on the course.","The dogleg right is a three shot hole for virtually all players. A well-placed bunker on the right will capture shots aimed at cutting the dogleg. Hit as much club as possible on the second shot and if the pin is tucked upper left, take at least one extra club to carry the huge frontal bunker.","This medium length par-4 sets up perfectly for an accurate tee shot. A well-placed drive in the center of the fairway will leave you with a medium to short iron. Remember: Check the ocean left, as putts will move in this direction.","Take aim directly over the island bunker with a 3-wood or long iron. A driver may leave you with a difficult downhill, sidehill, or worse yet, in the deep rough through the fairway. Do not attempt to cut the dogleg - the right side is fraught with danger. Hit the approach to the right side of the green, as all shots will slide left.","Check the pin placement and wind conditions. These two factors determine the choice of club. Beware the ocean left.","Set up for three shots on this hole. The best tee shot is to the left of the trees. The second shot is ideally placed on the left side of the fairway to avoid the tree overhanging the green. Your short iron into the green must carry the frontal bunker. And finally, putts will tend to fall oceanside."],
